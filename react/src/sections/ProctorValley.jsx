          The arid summer nights between 2005 and 2007 drew us out to the
          periphery of our surroundings, past the edges of exurban normalcy and
          into the dusty backroads of <i>elsewhere</i>. We knew there was
          something more out there, hiding amongst the cottonwood trees, and we
          were going to find it. We snaked through abandoned mental
          institutions, swerved sedans to dodge ghosts creeping on winding
          roads, and broke into overgrown sites of mass murders.
        </Paragaph>

        <Paragaph>
          Local folklore told of people who never saw daylight, whose skin
          shifted blue from isolation. Creatively, locals called them “Blue
          People.” And we burned countless gallons of gasoline chasing these
          mythologies through the backroads of Jamul. The main thoroughfare for
          the paranormal was a six-and-a-half-mile dirt corridor called Proctor
          Valley Road, which connected the backwoods of Rancho San Diego to
          somewhere undefined. We traversed it countless times until our SUV,
          propelled by equal parts petrol and vodka, fishtailed, somersaulted,
          and tumbled through Proctor Valley’s dirt embankment, nearly turning
          us into the ghosts we had been looking for.
        </Paragaph>

        <Paragaph>
          Proctor Valley Road has generational lore, the type of stories that
          get whispered about over bonfires, behind bleachers, and across late
          night telephone calls. It’s hauntings similar to the furtherest flung
          backroad of any ill-placed tract development: a creature that lurks
          just around the next bend, a bride-to-be hitchhiking on the shoulder,
          and the phantom hands imprinted in the dust of your back window (the
          latter, I can say with confidence, we did experience).
        </Paragaph>

        <Paragaph>
          Google Maps claims it’s 12 minutes straight-through, but I think thats
          how you end up crawling out of an upside down Toyota 4-Runner. It’s a
          shadowy, stretched, and serpentine road where cell phones went dark
          and radios tuned to static. We only made it to the other end one time.
        </Paragaph>

        <Paragaph>
          Surfacing at the other end of Proctor Valley Road was a surreal
          experience. After being in total rocky desolation, the dirt road
          leveled out into a perfect asphalt marked with an instant hit of
          Sodium Vapor. Two-hundred feet ahead, a four-way intersection was
          flanked with freshly-coated white fence, new curbs, and no houses. The
          streets unfurled toward nothing, reaching into the dark like a
          early-generation Playstation rendering engine that hadn’t yet filled
          in the environment. We crossed over into a mirror world and stood
          there speechless.
        </Paragaph>

        <Paragaph>
          I don’t know if we ever saw a ghost, or even believed in ghosts enough
          to see one, but seeing wasn’t the point. The opposite, we were trying
          to escape into places that weren’t observed, outside of the gaze of
          security guards, parents, and their heredity conception of the real.
          And we weren’t alone.

          Scraping the net for local folklore, a LiveJournal post from October
          4th 2006 comes up, in which user <code>zanev</code> attempts to source
          directions from Chula Vista to Jamul’s haunted Haven Bakery. The
          replies are littered with retellings of the lore: the owners daughter
          committed suicide, and upon finding her in the downstairs bathroom,
          the owner murdered every worker onsite, before turning the gun on
          himself. News reports and police filings from the time of Haven
          Bakery’s operation do not corroborate this story, but the streets and
          forums kept telling it. The network was aglow with beacons, shared
          stories of occult encounters threaded alongside positive words of
          encouragement, such as the August 31st 2007 reply likely shot from a
          flipped out T-Mobile Sidekiq: “fukin bitch just go fuk the pigs.”

        <Paragaph>
          Many commenters noted that H Street, <code>zanev</code>’s starting
          point, slipped beneath multiple freeways, spanned across nine miles of
          looped subdivisions and eventually dissolved into the unpaved length
          of Proctor Valley Road. Which meant that all along, there were others
          like us, pushing through from the other side of the mirror world,
          trying to make contact.
        </Paragaph>

          The homes at the far terminus of Proctor Valley Road would finally
          load in during the fall of 2011, with master-planned community like
          Verona at Rolling Hills Ranch and Aria at Bella Lago. But for a brief
          moment, people that traversed that pastoral plane hunting for the past
          stood at the four-way intersection of unlimited potential. In that
          rendering buffer, you could imagine a different future before it was
          built.
