          I’m not sure exactly when I met Raya, it was somewhere between
          December 2004 and January 2005. She ran with a crew of hardcore kids
          that seemed unbounded, ricocheting across San Diego like a burst of
          sparks from a snapped live wire, careless, untethered, and
          incandescent. The boys spoke almost entirely in borrowed lines from{' '}
          <i>Fight Club</i> and <i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i>, while
          the girls called each other by names from the MTV’s{' '}
          <i>Laguna Beach</i>. Most of them attended a Christian high school
          whose proper legal name, without irony, was “Christian High School.”
        </Paragaph>

        <Paragaph>
          Raya stood out in this group, the way her voice dropped low, how her
          hands stiffened into splayed out claws whenever she expressed
          excitement, and how her eyes turned toon when she keyed into something
          new. All of it underpinned with a deep earnestness and an acute
          awareness that we are, in every passing moment, watching our best
          histories emerge from the horizon. Raya used that energy to
          continually electrify the group, to charge them with the sense that
          something meaningful was always about to happen.

          These are the first pictures I have of Raya, captured with a sleek

          at a freezing cold house that shared an address with the used car lot
          it was tucked behind. I don’t know where the parents were. We seemed
          to ping-pong between vacant houses, backyards, and living rooms every
          night, slipping outside the bandwidth of supervision, young enough to
          be invisible, but old enough to feel briefly autonomous.

          Raya’s best friend, whose name was Alisha but was only ever referred
          to as “German,” wasn’t around the crew by the time I drifted in. She
          had moved to Florida sometime around the new year, and that sinister
          reality clinged to Raya. The day before the above pictures were taken,
          Raya wrote in her friends-only pre-algorithm eJournal:

            are the days with the best sunsets.. it was simpley amazingly
            beatiful(not sure if that all makes sence...wahtev)
            <br />
            <br />
            If you know me well you'll know that i cant spell very well.I'm
            sorry.
            <br />

            Well then me kelly ran around dancing singing laughing.. it was the
            best, it finally got dark and kelly,and i lay there in the grass
            looking at the stars singing copeland. It was so wonderful. Well my
            thoguhts went flying fomr one side of my brain to the other,
            thinking of past friends, my family that has past away.. it was in a
            weird way nice..
            <br />
            <br />
            …

          A month later, Spring Break brought Patrick, my best friend, the one
          who knew coffee shops that weren’t Starbucks and had{' '}
          <i>MAKE TRADE FAIR</i> Sharpie’d on his hand, to Florida. A family
          trip with his parents and sister, that I somehow managed to stow away
          on. In what now feels like an impossible coincidence, Raya was also
          going to Florida that same week to visit German. When you’re
          seventeen, moments don’t read as a series of logistics, but life just
          unfurling in front of you, you don’t question it.

          We bounced around Orlando for a week, with Raya and German hopping
          fences and slipping through hedges of theme parks to get in for free,
          with Pat insisting “there are no rules at Disney”, a line I think he
          whole heartedly believed. It was a hinge point, a new vector that shot
          out and away from daily routine, fusing our lives into wholly platonic
          relationships based on shared experience of just being “out there.”

          German and I developed a nocturnal schedule, teenagers sitting inches
          from the glow, waiting for a screen name to flash from gray to blue.
          We chatted as she moved around the country, Florida to SLO to Seattle
          to Arlington to Bellingham (editor’s note: it was around this time I
          started referring to her as Alisha, so that’s what’ll probably be used
          henceforth).

          Raya and I hung out weekly for the next few years, surrounded by a
          rotating cast that was always wandering chaotically, warping the
          suburban grid until distance folded in on itself. Raya grew
          inseparable from a girl named Kelly whose last name felt too twee to
          be real, but German’s absence kept pace with her like a shadow.

            Its kinda funny, i feel like were back in the ole days, where school
            didnt matter and our parents voices echoed in the halls.
            <br />I miss thee german. <br /> <br /> I talked to her this
            morning, as we were both laying in bed not in school.About
            everything..she just puts me in a good mood.Makes any situation
            funny.Once this body is 18 depending on the circumstances of the El
            Cajon life.These feet may be sticking out of the end of German's
            bed.For good.But We'll see.Who knows.

            German- my dear,my cupcake,my best friend. I love you dearly and am
            always here for you. Even at one in the morning. No distance can
            matter to me. I'm always here for you to lean on. I wish so badly i
            was here for you right now.Physically. Just to sit with, vent with,
            and star into nothingness with. I know you need me as much as i need
            you. I'm crossing my fingers in hope that the day we see each sooner
            then later.
            <br /> I've never needed a best friend more then i need you. Around
            times like these.And i know you need me just as much.
            <br /> Hang in there. Because i'm holding on for you. <br /> I love
            you.
