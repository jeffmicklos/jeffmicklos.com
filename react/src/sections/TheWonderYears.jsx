          I can’t quite remember her name, but this waitress held down the
          Rancho San Diego Denny’s in the Mid-2000s, with a thick accent and
          warm heart. I think her name was Nour, which translates to "light" in
          Arabic.

          Private Music was a record label founded in 1984, featuring Suzanne
          Ciani, Tangerine Dream, and Phillip Glass. Excellent label name. I’ve
          always had my own conception of "Private Music," music that I hold so
          close to my heart that it’s difficult for me to listen to around
          anyone else. It’s a rarified air reserved for the likes of Cocteau
          Twins, Kate Bush, Burial, Malibu, and some other deeply personal
          music. I think The Wonder Years have made the cut.

          In 2013, basements across the midwest were flooded with 20-somethings
          in cut-off jean shorts dogpiling each other to the wirey sounds of the
          days loud-quiet-loud Emo Revival. Chicago and Pennsylvania acted as
          twin crucibles that foraged the fourth-wave of emo, Chicago with Into
          It. Over It., Joie de Vivre, Pet Symmetry; Pennsylvania with Tigers
          Jaw, Algernon Cadwallader, Title Fight, and The Wonder Years.
        </Paragaph>

        <Paragaph>
          This new wave dropped the drama-class pouting of Fall Out Boy, Panic!
          at the Disco, and My Chemical Romance that propelled emo into critical
          velocity around 2008. Gone were theatrics and co-opted spectacles of
          arena tours like Taste of Chaos (sponsored by Rockstar Energy), the
          new beat was a back-to-basics philosophy of DIY shows, split EPs, and
          introspection. Musically, there was a hint of retromania rewinding the
          clock to moments just before MySpace-era commercialization, and
          embracing regional post-hardcore and math rock bands like Cap'n Jazz
          and American Football.

          Lyrically, there was a renegotiating the suburbs, PSAs about white
          privilege, treatise on what it means to grow up, and real-time
          meta-commentary about the scene that was blooming. Notably, there was
          an explicit eschewing of the misogynistic forces that alienated and
          preyed upon women in the years prior–a scene which, to paraphrase
          Jessica Hopper in 2003, “turned women into consumers and the
          consumed.” They were building a new world, right before the old one
          would crash down on their predecessors in a storm of predatory and
          statutory allegations in 2015.

          Meanwhile, in San Francisco, I was slipping further away from where I
          came from and who I was before. The magnetic pull of City Life, the
          allure of venture capital backed tee shirts, and the perpetual glow of
          an 11-inch Macbook Air kept me repelled against both the calmness and
          concerns I abandoned in the suburbs. It felt like growth, a
          repudiation of my childish ways, detachment as progress.

          The Wonder Year’s second album, 2011’s{' '}
          <i>Suburbia I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing</i>, presents 13
          songs about stasis and reckoning, convolved with interpolations of
          Allen Ginsburg’s 1956 steam-of-leftist-consciousness poem,{' '}
          <i>America</i>. It captured a suspended feeling, being stuck between
          collapse and renewal, but always finding hope from the flowers growing
          between the cracks in the pavement.

          “Coffee Eyes,” the eight track from <i>Suburbia…</i>, stands as an
          encapsulation of the albums themes. Lead singer Dan Campbell sets the
          context with a mirroring of America’s opening timestamp, “
          <i>two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956</i>,” before
          propelling through an account of returning to his old haunt, Michael’s
          Diner:

          Later verses splice friend-group lore into suburban folklore, painting
          the diner as the backdrop in which a rotating cast of characters play
          out incidental moments, moments that when seen from the rear-view
          mirror, accumulate into something much more defining, or at least
          memorable:

            I ended up here late at night on Thanksgiving, <br /> the fall that
            Colleen left. <br /> This was the place to call home, <br /> when it
            felt like the world didn't want us.

            I watched Mike slash Monica's tires, <br />
            (we laughed about it later). <br />I watched friendships dissolve,

          The song’s ending refrain takes on a double reading, one which speaks
          to a <i>Blair Witch</i>-esque inevitability of looped time and folded
          space, where hikers get unrelentingly shifted back to their starting
          point, cancelling any gained progress. The other reading, which I tend
          to prefer, acknowledges that some relics of our past, ones that were
          thought to be lost, are still holding space in the ever-present “now”,
          their inertness acting as a museum:

          “Coffee Eye’s” sister song, “Summers in PA,” recounts the summer
          nights with all your friends in town, losing money at the casino, and
          inevitably looping back to Dennys. It extends Coffee Eyes hometown
          embrace more directly, with it’s stubborn chorus and bridge section
          where Dan, joined this time on vocals by other Philadelphia
          basement-scene members, proclaims that they will not let their
          hometown curdle their hope into disaffection, or be chased off by, as
          Victor Gruen called it, suburbia’s “avenues of horror”.

          Music from these basements was quintessentially post-2008. The
          financial crisis robbed many of their futures, and even when markets “

          ” in 2013, millennials were left with a lifetime depressed wages and
          sans-serif hope that had moldered into dark nihilism. This was the
          sound of a generation that should have had the world at its
          Liberal-Arts fingertips. Emancipatory technology, socialism, the shape
          of punk to come, or even just a job: everything that was promised was
          cordoned off in the indefinite “future.”

          But in 2011, lyrics about burning through hours at Denny’s, personal
          undoings, and dead ends sounded like dispatches from a different
          timeline, a timeline I left to rot under a slick lamination of
          “adulthood.” I had dodged the bullet aimed at the heads of every
          millennial graduating into the wreckage 2009: I was salaried in the
          city where our collective future was being fabricated (but, to echo
          Gibson, not evenly distributed), in real-time by scruffy
          twenty-somethings with huge collections of pirated music and a
          bourgeois taste in brown liquor.

          If I’d found The Wonder Years in that era, I’m not sure I would have
          let them in. My big-city bubble was too metallic, too polished; it
          scattered anything so earnest. I didn’t yet understand their songs
          weren’t about idealizing the suburbs but trying to situate and survive
          it. Sometimes I feel like I missed something important. Better late
          than never, in 2025 The Wonder Years showed me the malleability of
          life: that it can bend, and keep bending, long after you think it has
          set.
